<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Budget App <a name="about-project"></a>

Introducing the Budget App - a mobile and web-based application that simplifies budget management. With this app, users can easily track their income and expenses, edit or delete each expense or category, and view a list of transactions categorized by type.

The Budget App provides an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to manage their finances on the go. Users can view their total income and expenses in real-time, giving them an accurate picture of their financial health at a glance.

One of the standout features of the Budget App is the ability to categorize transactions. Users can assign each transaction to a specific category, such as groceries, entertainment, or rent. This allows users to see how much money they are spending on each category and make adjustments as needed.

Editing or deleting expenses and categories is also a breeze with the Budget App. Users can easily make changes to any transaction or category with just a few taps or clicks.

Whether you're on a tight budget or just looking to keep track of your spending, the Budget App is the perfect tool for managing your finances. With its user-friendly interface, intuitive features, and powerful tracking capabilities, it's the ultimate budget management solution for anyone who wants to stay on top of their money.
